# Remote Fastfetch

`remotefetch` is an external Lavis Module API v6 module that answers `,remotefetch` with
fastfetch output from **another machine** — a laptop or workstation — instead
of the server the userbot runs on. It is distributed as `remotefetch.lmod`.

It has two parts:

| Part | Runs on | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remotefetch` | the Lavis host (server) | the Lavis module; asks the agent and renders the reply |
| `lavis-fetchd` | the remote machine | runs fastfetch locally and returns its output over HTTP |

```text
server (lavis)                        laptop (lavis-fetchd)
  ,remotefetch --logo NixOS
        │  POST /v1/fastfetch  Bearer <token>
        │  {"args":["--logo","NixOS"]}
        ▼
                                      fastfetch --config none --pipe --logo NixOS
        ▲
        │  200 {"output":"…","host":"xpert","took_ms":84}
   the command message is edited with the result
```

The userbot never gets shell access to that machine: it can ask for fastfetch
output and nothing else.

## Telegram commands

- `,remotefetch` or `,remotefetch.fetch` — fastfetch from the laptop;
- `,remotefetch --logo none --structure OS:Kernel:CPU:Memory` — any fastfetch option;
- `,remotefetch.status` — is the agent reachable, which fastfetch version it has, how
  long it has been up, and the round-trip latency.

Arguments are grouped the way a shell would group them, so
`,remotefetch --separator " -> "` arrives as one argument. No shell runs at any point:
tokens travel to the agent as a JSON array and reach `execve` unchanged, so
metacharacters stay data.

`,remotefetch.status` is the command to reach for when something is wrong — it
separates a sleeping laptop from a wrong token or a wrong address.

## When the laptop is asleep

Every successful fetch is stored in `cache.json` next to the module's config.
When the machine cannot answer, the module replies with the last snapshot it
has instead of refusing:

```text
🕒 xpert не на связи — показан последний снимок, 2ч 14мин назад.

OS: NixOS 25.11
Kernel: Linux 6.12.8
…

🔌 xpert недоступен (http://100.120.95.96:8471). Проверь, что он не спит, в сети и lavis-fetchd запущен.
```

The age leads the message and the live failure stays at the bottom, so the
reply never passes old output off as a fresh reading and still says why the
machine is quiet.

A snapshot is served only when the machine itself could not answer: it was
unreachable, it timed out, the agent was busy with another run, or fastfetch
failed on it. A rejected token, a malformed address and a missing fastfetch
are configuration errors — those are reported as errors, because answering
them with old output would leave you hunting a problem the module had already
named.

Snapshots are kept per argument set, four of them, newest first. If nothing
was ever fetched with the arguments you just used, the newest snapshot is sent
with a line saying which arguments produced it:

```text
🕒 xpert не на связи — показан последний снимок, 2ч 14мин назад.
⚠️ Снимок сделан с другими аргументами: --logo NixOS
```

`,remotefetch.status` names the age of the newest snapshot when the agent does
not answer, so you can tell a laptop that slept for ten minutes from one that
has not been seen in a week.

## Argument policy

Every fastfetch option is passed through except the ones that read or write a
path of the caller's choosing: `--file`, `--file-raw`, `--raw`, `--config`,
`--gen-config`, `--logo-type`, `--sixel`, `--kitty*`, `--iterm`, `--chafa`, and
`--logo` with a value that looks like a path. Without that list,
`,remotefetch --file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` would render a private key as the logo.

The agent enforces the policy; the module does not pre-check. A compromised or
outdated module therefore cannot widen what that machine will run. Start the
agent with `--allow-file-args` to lift the restriction.

The rest of the fastfetch surface is intentionally unrestricted, so output can
still reveal host, network, display, power and hardware data about the laptop
— the same exposure the built-in `,fastfetch` has for the Lavis host.

## Agent setup on the remote machine

Generate a token and keep it readable only by the account running the agent:

```bash
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/.config/lavis-fetchd-token
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 > ~/.config/lavis-fetchd-token
```

Run the agent on a private network address — a Tailscale or WireGuard address,
never a public one. It has no transport encryption of its own:

```bash
lavis-fetchd \
  --listen 100.120.95.96:8471 \
  --token-file ~/.config/lavis-fetchd-token
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--listen` | `127.0.0.1:8471` | listening address |
| `--token-file` | — | file holding the shared bearer token (required) |
| `--timeout` | `2.5s` | maximum fastfetch run time |
| `--allow-file-args` | `false` | permit the file-reading fastfetch options |

The agent refuses to start when the token file is world-readable or holds
fewer than 16 bytes. Both endpoints require the token: an unauthenticated
health probe would hand out the hostname and fastfetch version to anything that
can reach the listener.

Run it as a **user** service, not a system service: fastfetch reads the session
environment to detect the desktop, window manager, terminal and displays, so a
root service reports the hardware correctly and leaves those fields empty. The
NixOS module below does this.

### NixOS

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.lavis.nixosModules.fetchd ];

  services.lavis-fetchd = {
    enable = true;
    user = "wardar";
    listenAddress = "100.120.95.96:8471";     # this machine on the tailnet
    tokenFile = "/run/secrets/lavis-fetchd-token";
  };
}
```

Do not put the token in the Nix store — every store path is world-readable.
Use agenix, sops-nix, or a file placed outside the store.

The module enables lingering for that user so the agent keeps answering while
nobody is logged in. Set `openFirewall = true` if the tailnet interface is not
already covered by `networking.firewall.trustedInterfaces`.

## Module setup on the Lavis host

The module reads `config.json` from `LAVIS_MODULE_STATE_DIR` — Lavis starts
modules with a cleared environment, so this is the only path it can rely on:

```bash
install -d -m 700 /var/lib/lavis/.local/state/lavis/modules/remotefetch
install -m 600 /dev/null /var/lib/lavis/.local/state/lavis/modules/remotefetch/config.json
```

```json
{
  "url": "http://100.120.95.96:8471",
  "token": "the same token as the agent",
  "label": "xpert"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | agent address, `http://host:port` |
| `token` | shared bearer token |
| `token_file` | read the token from this path instead of inlining it |
| `label` | name used in replies; defaults to the hostname the agent reports |

The module writes `cache.json` into that same state directory, mode `600`, one
snapshot per argument set and four at most. Deleting it costs nothing but the
offline fallback, until the next successful fetch refills it.

When run outside Lavis the module also accepts
`~/.config/lavis/remotefetch.json` for its config and keeps snapshots in
`~/.cache/lavis/remotefetch.json`.

## Build, test and install

```bash
cd modules/remotefetch
go test ./...
go vet ./...
./build-lmod.sh
```

Send `dist/remotefetch.lmod` to Saved Messages in a new message with:

```text
,lm install
```

Review the inspection plan and confirm its full approval ID within ten minutes:

```text
,lm confirm XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
```

The installed module remains disabled. Enable it and restart Lavis:

```bash
lavis modules enable remotefetch
```

On NixOS, install it declaratively instead:

```nix
services.lavis.extensions = [
  {
    id = "remotefetch";
    package = inputs.lavis.packages.${pkgs.system}.lavis-extension-remotefetch;
  }
];
```

## Capabilities

`network` to reach the agent, `persistent_state_read` to read `config.json`,
and `persistent_state_write` to keep the last fetch in `cache.json`. The module
holds no Telegram capabilities: it sends no messages, reads none, and makes no
Telegram RPC — it answers a command with text and nothing else.

## Fidelity

Running as a user service gets the session-dependent fields right — desktop,
window manager, displays, theme. Two fields still differ from what an
interactive run shows, because fastfetch derives them from its own process
tree: `Shell` names `lavis-fetchd` rather than your login shell, and `Terminal`
names the agent too. Exclude them when it matters:

```text
,remotefetch --structure OS:Host:Kernel:Uptime:Packages:WM:CPU:GPU:Memory:Disk
```

## Timing

The Module API v6 lifecycle deadline is five seconds. The budget nests inside
it: the command gets 4s, the HTTP request 3.5s, and the agent's fastfetch run
2.5s. A laptop that is asleep or off the network fails on connect and answers
in milliseconds rather than burning the deadline. The snapshot it falls back
on is read from local disk, so the offline reply is the fastest one the module
sends.
